Space Complexity: amount of physical memory that an algorith requires to complete.

Time Complexity: number of operations an algorithm requires to complete.

Big O Notation: a way to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. Can help us understand how an algorithm
    will perform in best case scenarios, worst case scenarios, and on average.
