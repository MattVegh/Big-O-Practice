Space Complexity: amount of physical memory that an algorith requires to complete.

Time Complexity: number of operations an algorithm requires to complete.

Big O Notation: a way to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. Can help us understand how an algorithm
    will perform in best case scenarios, worst case scenarios, and on average.

Classifications:
    Constant Time (best) - No matter the size of your input, the algorithm will take the same amount of time to complete.

    Logarithmic Time (second best) - Run time increases slowly. If an algorithm takes 1 second to complete with
        with an input of 10, it will take 2 seconds with 100 inputs, and 3 seconds with 1000. 

    Linear Time - Running times directly proportional to the size of the input. 

    Polynomial Time - Running time that is input size (n) raised to a constant power (k). O(n^k). Easiest way to understand
        Polynomial time is with nested loops. An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping would be n^2, 
        3 levels of looping would be n^3, and so on.
